After finding [Subtle Patterns][patterns], I came across this little gem (not a ruby gem) that allows a user to use the webapp's canvas to create a custom pattern and outputs css code to use. You can also download the resulting png and integrate it that way as well. 

[Patternify][css-gen]

Enjoy, again!
